In this question we have to find the first discoverable peak for a 1-D array
We are using the foll cases in this question
If the first element of he array is greater than the next element than it is the peak.
If the last element of the array is greater than the second last element of the same element than that element is the peak
In the middle cases we will traverse from the second element to the second last element
if any element is both greater than its previous element and its next element than that element is the peak element
