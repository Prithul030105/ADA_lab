Convex Hull Concept
A Convex Hull is the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It can be thought of as the shape a rubber band would form when stretched around the given points.

Key Properties:
Convexity: Any line segment connecting two points inside the convex hull must also be inside the hull.

Minimal Boundary: It contains the minimal number of points required to enclose all given points.

Ordering: The points on the hull are ordered in a cyclic manner.

Applications of Convex Hull:
Computer Graphics: Used in object boundary detection.

Robotics & Path Planning: For obstacle avoidance.

Geographical Information Systems: To define outer boundaries of regions.

Image Processing: Shape analysis.
