The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where we have a set of items, each with a weight and a value. The goal is to determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight does not exceed a given limit, and the total value is maximized.

Types of Knapsack Problems
1. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
Each item can be either taken (1) or not taken (0).

Cannot take fractions of an item.

Solved using Dynamic Programming (DP).

2. Fractional Knapsack Problem (Greedy Approach)
Items can be broken into smaller pieces.

We can take a fraction of an item if it fits.

Solved using a Greedy Algorithm.
